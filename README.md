# BI Lighthouse Project
Landing Page for better navigation and discovery. 

## Context
To get Tableau's Project/Workbooks/Views metadata we used a schema provided by the DE team called *tablaeu*

Since discovering we can access this data via API's and Python we created the Landing Page using this method instead.
